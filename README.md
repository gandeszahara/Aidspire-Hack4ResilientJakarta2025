### 📝 Description
Jakarta faces worsening floods due to land subsidence, hitting informal settlements hardest as they lack proper infrastructure, early warning, and support. Aid and upgrades are rarely targeted using combined risk data. To fix this, we’ll merge sociodemographic, climate, and building data into a standardized spatial grid for scalable analysis. Using supervised composite risk scoring and demographic filters, we’ll pinpoint high-risk zones for targeted aid. Policymakers will use a web map to plan and track interventions, while citizens can check aid eligibility, submit complaints, and ask questions via WhatsApp. This ensures risk insights reach both government and communities, driving real action.
