### 📝 Description
This project is designed to support both the government and citizens in preparing for floods—before, during, and after they occur.

For citizens, the system allows individuals to check the flood risk of their homes by simply inputting their coordinates (e.g., via location sharing). This personalized risk check ensures more accurate results, as it is tailored to each user. The analysis uses geospatial variables such as proximity to historical flood-prone areas (based on 2024 data), the nearest healthcare facilities, and available shelters. With this information, citizens can better understand their vulnerability and take informed steps to prepare and respond.

For the government, the platform provides insights on how to prioritize aid distribution during flood events. Aid priority is determined by combining a flood prediction index with informal settlement mapping, assigning equal weight to both factors. The results are presented through an interactive dashboard map, enabling data-driven decision-making in crisis situations.
